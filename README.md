# Basis Experiment

Your task is to implement the "Request a letter" UI. Designs can be found [here](https://github.com/moroshko/basis-experiment/tree/master/designs).

Things to keep in mind:

- The UI should be responsive.
- The UI should be accessible.
- The actual form submission is out of scope.
- Footer links should point to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/latitudefinancialservices/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/latitude-financial-services/).

To start:

1. `git clone https://github.com/moroshko/basis-experiment.git`
2. `cd basis-experiment`
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn start`
